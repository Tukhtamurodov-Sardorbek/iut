## Course Project: AI-Powered Android App
The final project requires students to design and develop an original Android application that solves a real-world problem using AI. 
*   **Requirement:** Must utilize at least one major AI component (e.g., Generative AI API, on-device ML model, or AI-driven personalization).
*   **Tools:** Students are encouraged to use AI coding assistants (like Gemini in Android Studio) to enhance their productivity.
